# ClockDown
Clockdown is the social game for the socially distant. Blast pesky viruses out of the way and dodge the anti-maskers as you run, jump, and shoot your way through five action-packed stages.
Face off against friends and family via online multiplayer, and see if you have what it takes to hoard the most toilet roll points before the time runs out and you hit the lockdown!

## Third-Party Software
We embraced a lot of open source packages from the Unity Asset Store that allowed us to keep the focus on building our game and not implementing certain features that could've potentially slowed down the development cycle of ClockDown.
